            <h3><strong>Our Mission</strong></h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Strong Through Our Plan (The STOP Coalition) was begun in the early 1990s by a group of citizens concerned about the growing problem of substance abuse in Southern West Virginia. As the organization grew and progressed, a mission was adopted: STOP is committed to serving and mobilizing our communities around the issues of substance abuse in order to promote community well being and a high quality of life that is free from the impact of substance abuse and its adverse effects.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                To move toward accomplishing this mission, two broad goals have been articulated:

                Reduce substance abuse and related problems in Mingo County.

                Promote cultural change by engaging in research, education, coalition building, environmental management, intervention, and other appropriate activities to reduce high risk alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use in the community.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The STOP Coalition provides services regarding substance abuse prevention and recovery. More importantly, we function to provide assistance and support to organizations already in place to add drug and alcohol prevention to their goals. By incorporating prevention into the programs of existing resources such as after-school programs and summer day camps, we maximize the reach of both organizations. Our purpose is community facilitation. The grassroots approach to social change is the most effective, and we play a key role in organizing groups for the common cause of substance abuse prevention.

            <h3> Programs That We Utilize in the School Systems</h3>
            <hr />
            <h4>
                Second Step
            </h4>
            <br />
            <p>
                Supported by music and videos, take-home activities, and stories kids relate to, the developmentally appropriate Second Step lessons have helped teachers instill social-emotional skills in their students for over 20 years. Best of all, the student lessons are easy to teach, right out of the box!
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h4>
                Keep a Clear Mind
            </h4>
            <br />
            <p>
                The Center publishes health education materials that have been rigorously evaluated and have been found to produce positive student outcomes. Evaluation papers have been presented at the annual meetings of professional/scholarly associations and published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Center staff develop new materials, conduct research/evaluation studies, prepare scholarly papers, journal manuscripts, and provide training workshops.

            <br />
            <p>
                All Stars is a school-based program for middle school students (11-14 years old) designed to prevent and delay the onset of high-risk behaviors such as drug use, bullying, and early sexual activity.

                The All Stars curriculum includes highly interactive group activities, games and art projects, small group discussions, one-on-one sessions, a parent component, optional online activities and worksheets, and a celebration ceremony.
