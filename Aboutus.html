            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>H & W ATV Lodge, located near the Rockhouse trailhead of the Hatfield McCoy Trail, opened for business in March of 2003. We (Harold and Wanda Thompson, the H and W of the name) planned the lodge especially for the comfort and convenience of the trail riders. We live next door, and we will be happy to help you with directions, reservations, and information. We were born and grew up in Logan County, so we can tell you a lot about the area. In fact, Great-grandfather William Thompson lived here during the Civil War when the state was still a part of Virginia.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We are located on Route 10, about 4 miles south of Man and 15 miles south of Logan. The winding roads of southern West Virginia can be confusing, so we have included detailed driving directions to our lodge. You might want to print these directions out and bring them along with your map. We also have GPS coordinates listed if you would like to use this technology.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you would like more information about our accommodations, take a look at the individual pages with a more detailed description and pictures. We are proud of our accommodations and want to make your stay with us comfortable. Whether you are in the lodge or mobile home, do not hesitate to let us know if you need anything.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>If you need more information, just give us a call at (304) xxx- xxxx or email us.</h3>
