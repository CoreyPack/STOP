                On November 6th, 2015, Sandy Ridge Baptist Church traveled from Monroe, NC to Crossroads Recovery Home in Gilbert.  With them, they brought several donations including an abundance of laundry detergent, deodorant, shampoo, soap, cleaning supplies, paper, and food items as well as many other toiletries. They spent the evening with the residents, prepared dinner for everyone, and enjoyed great fellowship.  A great time was had by all… there was laughing, games, and also inspirational experiences and personal journeys shared with the group.
